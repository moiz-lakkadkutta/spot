# Spot — notes for coding agents

Guided movement coaching for mobility and wellbeing on the living-room TV. The phone is the camera, the TV is the coach. Not a medical device.

- pnpm + Turborepo monorepo. `apps/api` (Express 4 + Zod + Prisma + pg-boss + Socket.IO), `apps/expo` (Fire OS),
  `apps/vega` (Vega OS, created with the Vega CLI), `packages/shared-ui` (screens; **no native imports outside the Vega-supported list**),
  `packages/contracts` (Zod schemas shared by api/ui/phone), `packages/heuristics` (pose math, tested), `infra` (CDK).
- Design tokens live in `packages/shared-ui/src/theme/tokens.ts`. Sizes are px at 1920×1080 × `scale` (Fire OS 0.5, Vega 1). Never hard-code a colour outside tokens.
- Focus is a physical change (outline + 1.04 scale, 150 ms), never colour alone. Every focusable has `aria-label` stating purpose.
- Read the plan first: docs/PLAN.md. Tickets in TASKS.md. Friction → `pnpm friction "<title>"`.
- Research before writing: cite the doc URL in the PR for any Amazon/AWS API you touch.
- Wording rules: docs/decisions/0002-wording.md (enforced by `pnpm lint:words`).
